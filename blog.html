            I had always dreamed of being a doctor, and up until foundation, that was the only job I had ever wanted.
            Who knows what journey someone else took before me? 
            Both Allah and I plan, but Allah is the greatest planner.
            I followed the flow and ended up where I am now.
            I realised that if I had gone forÂ a medical degree, it would have been difficult to get a nice result, and I would not have made the dean's list.
            It is an honour for me to be a student pursuing this degree.
            Although I can't fulfil my parents' dream of becoming a doctor, it was nice to tell them that their daughter is a dean list student.
            I appreciate my lectures for helping me learn, guiding me, and awarding me excellent grades.
            I intend to keep achieving this goal until I finish my degree. Please pray for me.
